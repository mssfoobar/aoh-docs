This is useful for video wall scenarios.\\n\\n#### Incident Management:\\n\\n-   Incident page has a new search bar to facilitate better navigation and experience.\\n\\n#### Record & Replay:\\n\\n-   Added quick-start & configuration guide in [AGIL Ops Hub Docs](https://mssfoobar.github.io/aoh-docs/docs/category/-guides-2/).\\n\\n#### Workflow Management:\\n\\n-   Workflows now support manual switch recovery when none of the switch conditions are met.\\n-   The workflow management engine now support looping back of processes in workflows.\\n-   The workflow designer is now integrated as part of the web application (instead of a separate stand-alone service).\\n\\n## Framework Features\\n\\n#### Web Application Framework:\\n\\n-   A new UI State store is now available for developers to restore users\' UI states \\\\[[Docs Link](https://mssfoobar.github.io/aoh-docs/docs/web/api/ui_state)\\\\].\\n-   Streaming subscription variable updates on retires can now be controlled via operation context \\\\[[Docs Link](http://localhost:3030/aoh-docs/docs/web/guides/development#broken-queries-subscriptions-and-retries)\\\\].\\n\\n#### Service Application Framework:\\n\\n-   Changes from Hasura GraphQL to pure SQL queries using [sqlc](https://github.com/sqlc-dev/sqlc).\\n-   Services (starting with `Incident Management` & `Record & Replay`) now support schema migration on service startup using `go-migrate`.\\n-   Updated _Readme_ with details on how to use `sqlc` & `go-migrate`.\\n\\n## Fixes\\n\\n-   Dashboard widget configuration no longer applies to multiple dashboard widgets of the same type when editing one dashboard.\\n-   GraphQL subscriptions now retry quickly and exponentially backoff correctly, as well as no longer throw errors to `urql`, causing re-subscriptions to occur at the `graphql-ws` level instead of the `urql` level.\\n\\n    This means subscriptions no longer cause unnecessary errors when JWT tokens expire and the WebSocket closes, and retries are stable.\\n\\n-   Fixed record & replay sometimes having random time skips.\\n-   Fixed record & replay UI sometimes not loading correctly.\\n-   Fixed chat messages sometimes being duplicated or coming in out-of-order.\\n-   Fixed incident notifications sometimes being duplicated or coming in out-of-order.\\n-   Fixed map crashing when being accessed directly via URL (but worked when accessed via side menu)\\n-   Domain used for cookies must now be set explicitly (via the `PUBLIC_DOMAIN` environment variable) instead of implicitly using the top level domain. This allows different versions of the app to be deployed on the same domain (by using separating cookies by sub-domains).\\n\\n## Field Day\\n\\nField Day is an application build on AGIL Ops Hub that introduces the management of `trips`. A trip is composed of the many `participants` that might partake in the trip, as well as an `itinerary`, which is a collection of `activities`.\\n\\n-   Web Application\\n\\n    Users have the ability to view and manage trips, this involves:\\n\\n    -   Adding or removing participant\\n    -   Adding or removing activities from the itinerary\\n    -   Assigning/re-assigning in-charges for the trips.\\n\\n    The application also provides a map to show all on-going trips, as well as any associated incidents that might cause need for attention (e.g. a sudden earthquake might negatively impact a nearby trip).\\n\\n-   Mobile\\n\\n    A flutter mobile application is also available for `Field Day`, allowing personnel who are in charge of a trip to manage incidents that take place within their trip by:\\n\\n    -   Viewing existing incidents that are happening during the trip\\n    -   Creating incidents associated with the trip\\n    -   Tagging incidents with a geolocation.\\n\\n# Release Tags\\n\\n-   Web: [aoh-web v2.1.0](https://github.com/mssfoobar/aoh-web/releases/tag/v2.1.0)\\n-   Record & Replay: [ar2-rnr v1.5.0](https://github.com/mssfoobar/ar2-rnr/releases/tag/v1.5.0)\\n-   Incident Management: [ar2-ims v1.2.0](https://github.com/mssfoobar/ar2-ims/releases/tag/v1.2.0)\\n-   Workflow Management: [ar2-wfe v1.2.0](https://github.com/mssfoobar/ar2-wfe/releases/tag/v1.2.0)\\n\\n-   Field Day Mobile Application: [field-day-flutter v0.1.0](https://github.com/mssfoobar/field-day-flutter/releases/tag/v0.1.0)\\n-   Field Day Trip Management: [demo-trip-management v0.1.0](https://github.com/mssfoobar/demo-trip-management/releases/tag/v0.1.0)"},{"id":"versioning-scheme","metadata":{"permalink":"/aoh-docs/releases/versioning-scheme","editUrl":"https://github.com/mssfoobar/aoh-docs/tree/main/blog/blog/2024-03-21_versioning.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-03-21_versioning.md","title":"Versioning Scheme","description":"Make sense of how AGIL Ops Hub is versioned.","date":"2024-03-21T16:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"March 21, 2024","tags":[{"label":"versioning","permalink":"/aoh-docs/releases/tags/versioning"},{"label":"semver","permalink":"/aoh-docs/releases/tags/semver"},{"label":"pragmatic versioning","permalink":"/aoh-docs/releases/tags/pragmatic-versioning"},{"label":"release","permalink":"/aoh-docs/releases/tags/release"}],"readingTime":1.015,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Dois","title":"Senior Software Engineer","image_url":"https://github.com/DoisKoh.png","imageURL":"https://github.com/DoisKoh.png"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Versioning Scheme","description":"Make sense of how AGIL Ops Hub is versioned.","slug":"versioning-scheme","authors":[{"name":"Dois","title":"Senior Software Engineer","image_url":"https://github.com/DoisKoh.png","imageURL":"https://github.com/DoisKoh.png"}],"tags":["versioning","semver","pragmatic versioning","release"],"hide_table_of_contents":false,"date":"2024-03-21:16:00"},"prevItem":{"title":"0.1.0","permalink":"/aoh-docs/releases/release-0.1.0"}},"content":"## Overall System - Pragmatic Versioning\\n\\nMoving forward, we\'ll be using `Pragmatic Versioning` for our overall release version numbers. We intend to provide more consistent release notes with a release versioning scheme that will be useful for projects utilizing AGIL Ops Hub.\\n\\nPragmatic versioning comes with 3 numbers, separated by periods, just like semantic versioning. However, the numbers correspond to `BIG RELEASE` . `ANNOUNCEMENT` . `INCREMENT`. Read more about [Pragmatic Versioning](https://github.com/seveibar/pragmaticversioning).\\n\\n## Individual Services - Semantic Versioning\\n\\nAs for individual services and/or packages and libraries, we\'ll be sticking to the typical [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).\\n\\n## Why the discrepancy?\\n\\nIt makes more sense to use pragmatic versioning for the overall system as it is actually an aggregation of many different\\nservices, as well as the architecture of the entire system. The versioning of the overall system also carries branding,\\nand other meanings. If we use semantic versioning for that, it can be quite unclear which number to increase for the\\noverall system, or simply not useful. Pragmatic versioning more closely matches the message we want to convey.\\n\\nAs for indivdual services or packages, it\'s much clearer whether a change is a `MAJOR`, `MINOR`, or `PATCH` and that\\nmessage can be conveyed through the version numbers."}]}')}}]);
