The first number denotes large changes that might be associated with the overall\\nbrand and/or architecture of `AOH`, the following 3 numbers follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) for the\\nsystem as a whole - meaning if there are any changes (breaking) that require some migration steps in any of the deployed\\nservices, we\'ll increase the `major`.\\n\\nHappy release day!\\n\\n### Applications\\n\\n#### Dashboarding:\\n\\n-   Dashboard Selector & List:\\n    -   A new dashboard selector, with labels, filtering and favoriting has been added.\\n    -   A dashboard list with a dashboard preview is now available from selecting `Browse All` in the new dashboard selector.\\n    -   Users\' last selected dashboard will now be saved and restored when revisiting the page.\\n-   The widget preview has been updated to much more accurately reflect how a widget might look in a dashboard.\\n-   A new full screen mode button has been added that can be activated in view mode (press ESC to exit); this mode hides the side panels and makes the dashboard fill up the entire screen. This is useful for video wall scenarios.\\n\\n#### Incident Management:\\n\\n-   Incident page has a new search bar to facilitate better navigation and experience.\\n\\n#### Record & Replay:\\n\\n-   Added quick-start & configuration guide in [AGIL Ops Hub Docs](https://mssfoobar.github.io/aoh-docs/docs/category/-guides-2/).\\n\\n#### Workflow Management:\\n\\n-   Workflows now support manual switch recovery when none of the switch conditions are met.\\n-   The workflow management engine now support looping back of processes in workflows.\\n-   The workflow designer is now integrated as part of the web application (instead of a separate stand-alone service).\\n\\n### Framework\\n\\n#### Web Application Framework:\\n\\n-   A new UI State store is now available for developers to restore users\' UI states \\\\[[Docs Link](https://mssfoobar.github.io/aoh-docs/docs/web/api/ui_state)\\\\].\\n-   Streaming subscription variable updates on retires can now be controlled via operation context \\\\[[Docs Link](http://localhost:3030/aoh-docs/docs/web/guides/development#broken-queries-subscriptions-and-retries)\\\\].\\n\\n#### Service Application Framework:\\n\\n-   Changes from Hasura GraphQL to pure SQL queries using [sqlc](https://github.com/sqlc-dev/sqlc).\\n-   Services (starting with `Incident Management` & `Record & Replay`) now support schema migration on service startup using `go-migrate`.\\n-   Updated _Readme_ with details on how to use `sqlc` & `go-migrate`.\\n\\n# Fixes:\\n\\n-   Dashboard widget configuration no longer applies to multiple dashboard widgets of the same type when editing one dashboard.\\n-   GraphQL subscriptions now retry quickly and exponentially backoff correctly, as well as no longer throw errors to `urql`, causing re-subscriptions to occur at the `graphql-ws` level instead of the `urql` level.\\n\\n    This means subscriptions no longer cause unnecessary errors when JWT tokens expire and the WebSocket closes, and retries are stable.\\n\\n-   Fixed record & replay sometimes having random time skips.\\n-   Fixed record & replay UI sometimes not loading correctly.\\n-   Fixed chat messages sometimes being duplicated or coming in out-of-order.\\n-   Fixed incident notifications sometimes being duplicated or coming in out-of-order.\\n-   Fixed map crashing when being accessed directly via URL (but worked when accessed via side menu)\\n-   Domain used for cookies must now be set explicitly (via the `PUBLIC_DOMAIN` environment variable) instead of implicitly using the top level domain. This allows different versions of the app to be deployed on the same domain (by using separating cookies by sub-domains).\\n\\n# Release Tags\\n\\n-   Web: [aoh-web v2.1.0](https://github.com/mssfoobar/aoh-web/releases/tag/v2.1.0)\\n-   Record & Replay: [ar2-rnr v1.5.0](https://github.com/mssfoobar/ar2-rnr/releases/tag/v1.5.0)\\n-   Incident Management: [ar2-ims v1.2.0](https://github.com/mssfoobar/ar2-ims/releases/tag/v1.2.0)\\n-   Workflow Management: [ar2-wfe v1.2.0](https://github.com/mssfoobar/ar2-wfe/releases/tag/v1.2.0)"}]}')}}]);
