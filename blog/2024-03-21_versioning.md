Moving forward, we'll be using `Pragmatic Versioning` for our version numbers. We intend to provide more consistent release notes with a release versioning scheme that will be useful for projects utilizing AGIL Ops Hub.

Pragmatic versioning comes with 3 numbers, separated by periods, just like semantic versioning. However, the numbers correspond to `BIG RELEASE` . `ANNOUNCEMENT` . `INCREMENT`. Read more about [Pragmatic Versioning](https://github.com/seveibar/pragmaticversioning).
