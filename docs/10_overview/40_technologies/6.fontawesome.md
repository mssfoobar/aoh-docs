# Font Awesome

We've chosen `Font Awesome` to be our primary icon library.

## What is Font Awesome?

`Font Awesome` is a font and icon library and toolkit based on CSS.

### Why we've chosen Font Awesome

Font Awesome has the ability to render icons efficiently as font glyphs - this has the advantage of having them all be
indefinitely scalable, due to them being vector based, and also recoloured. This means we can re-theme these icons
programmatically. Font Awesome also has a new framework to allow stacking and animations of icons, providing us even
more power and flexibility (e.g. we can quickly create loading spinners, or unread message counts overlaid on icons).

## Using Font Awesome

The typical usage of Font Awesome uses `<i>` tags with `fa-` classes, however, this requires the entire set of icons to
be loaded as a Font. If we're only using a few icons from the set, this can be very wasteful in terms of
space-efficiency.

Instead, we can include the `SVG` directly into the page with the following method:

Import `icon` from `@fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core` and import the icon you'll be using (e.g. faClock):

```ts
import { icon } from "@fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core";
import { faClock } from "@fortawesome/pro-solid-svg-icons";
```

Use Svelte's HTML tags to render the icon directly.

```jsx
{@html icon(faClock).html}
```

:::danger
Svelte doesn't perform any sanitization of the expression inside \{@html ...\} before it gets inserted into the DOM.
To avoid the risk of XSS attacks, do not include any user input in the expression, or ensure you manually escape it.
