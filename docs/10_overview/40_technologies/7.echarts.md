# Apache ECharts

We use `Apache ECharts` as our primary charting library.

## What is ECharts?

`ECharts`, a powerful, interactive charting and visualization library for the web.

### Why we've chosen ECharts

Compared to other popular charting libraries like `chart.js`, `ECharts` has a very rich set of charts and visualization
options. It is highly configurable, full of a large variety of chart types, has a great default clean look,
and is performant; with incremental rendering and data streaming, it even has the ability to render tens of millions of
data points.

It also has the added benefit of being open source.

## Using ECharts

With Svelte & Svelte Kit, you can import charts and components from `ECharts` into your app:

```ts
let chartContainer;

onMount(async () => {
    const echarts = await import('echarts');
    let chart = echarts.init(chartContainer);
    let option = {
        series: [
            {
                type: 'pie',
                data: [
                    {
                        value: 335,
                        name: 'Direct Visit',
                    },
                    {
                        value: 234,
                        name: 'Union Ad',
                    },
                    {
                        value: 1548,
                        name: 'Search Engine',
                    },
                ],
            },
        ],
    };
    chart.setOption(option);
});
```

Remember to bind the element reference to the chart container that ECharts uses:

```jsx
<div bind:this={chartContainer} />
```

:::note

Because Svelte Kit code must be isomorphic, and ECharts assumes that the code is run in the browser, you can only can
only import ECharts in the browser, hence, the ` await import('echarts')` within the `onMount` function.
