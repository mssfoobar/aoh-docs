# MapBox

`MapBox` is a library we use to render dynamic maps.

<ThemedImage
    width="400"
    alt="MapBox Logo"
    sources={{
        light: mapBoxLogo,
        dark: mapBoxLogoDark,
    }}
/>

## What is MapBox?

`MapBox` is a client-side JavaScript library that uses WebGL to render interactive maps from vector tiles.
You can use `Mapbox` to display Mapbox maps in a web browser or client, add user interactivity, and customize the map experience in your application.

### Why we've chosen MapBox

Apart from `MapBox`, we also have the option of using `OpenLayers` and `Leaflet.js`, which are both open source.
Leaflet is very easy to get started with, however, for more complex use cases, OpenLayers or MapBox is a better choice.

MapBox actually uses a lot of Leaflet.js code to render tiles, however, MapBox has
[MapBox GL JS](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-js) - adding a rich graphics layer which tips us toward using
MapBox over OpenLayers.
