# Workflow Designer

Web diagramming application allows users to design and collaborate in the creation of ESOP workflows.

## Simple Workflow
Let's build a simple workflow by below steps:
- Drag and drop BPMN elements from the palette onto the canvas
- Assign the element properties by clicking on it to reveal the properties panel on the right side
- Click on the save button to save it

## Data Flow
Activity that returns data will be assigned to its result variable name which can be further utilized in subsequent activities or gateways.

## Gateways
### Parallel

#### Splitting
A splitting parallel gateway executes multiple activities in parallel creating multiple sequence flows.

#### Merging
A merging parallel gateway waits until all the incoming sequence flows are completed before moving on to the next steps.

### Switch
A Switch is an exclusive gateway which will only proceed when the condition defined inside the flow is true.
If there are conflicting conditions, the lowest flow order number will take precedence over others.

## Form
Form templates which are generated by [Form Designer](form_designer.md) can be used as user input activities in workflow.
When the user submit the form, form activities will return the submitted data in JSON object.

To access the value of the form input, use the switch-flow advance mode tab and access them by their form components key.

## Event
Events can be drawn at the intermediate between two processes (intermediate event) or the boundary of the activity (boundary event).
Boundary events can be either interrupting or non-interrupting.
Interrupting events will cancel the host activity and other boundary events attached to the host.

## CallActivity
CallActivity can execute another workflow and store its output inside the result variable.
