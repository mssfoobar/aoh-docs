# Pitfalls

This section should document common mistakes, errors, and pitfalls. If an errors message is being addressed, it should
be listed written down wholesale.

## Error: Docusaurus found broken links!

> Error: Docusaurus found broken links!
>
> Please check the pages of your site in the list below, and make sure you don't reference any path that does not exist.
> Note: it's possible to ignore broken links with the 'onBrokenLinks' Docusaurus configuration, and let the build pass.

Docusaurus' build process thoroughly checks for broken links in your markdown files and gives you an exhaustive list.

After the error messsage, that list of link locations will be given to you - check to confirm that all links are valid
before builing and trying again.

## Another Pitfall Example

The first one is an actual error you might experience while developing on docusaurus, this one is just an example to
show you how you should add to the list of mistakes, errors and pitfalls.
