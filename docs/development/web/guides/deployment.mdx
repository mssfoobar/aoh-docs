# Deployment

## Production Preview

Before preparing a build for production, ensure that you've conducted the appropriate tests.

1. Build
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
2. Run Preview (use production build files)
    ```bash
    npm run preview
    ```

## Deployment

This project is deployed automatically via GitHub Actions and ArgoCD on every main branch commit.

Refer to the `.github/workflows` yaml files to find out more about the workflows.

Our pipeline for continuous deployment is:

1. A pull request is submitted to merge a feature branch in.
2. Unit tests are run on the pull request
3. When the pull request is merged, the integration tests are run and the files are deployed to the staging server.

If you wish to deploy it yourself, run `npm run build` to generate the build folder and copy the build output to your
servers. Then, run `node ./build/index.js` to start the web server.

import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";

<TabItem value="Windows PowerShell" label="Windows (PowerShell)" default>

```bash
npm run build
$env:PORT=<desired_port>; node ./build/index.js
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Windows CMD" label="Windows (cmd)">

```bash
npm run build

```

```bash

## Adding Environment Variables

When you create new environment variables to use in the project, you will need to ensure that the CI/CD pipeline is
configured with the right values for those variables and the container is able to read it upon deployment.

There are 4 places to look out for:

-   [Wiki - Environment Variables](https://github.com/mssfoobar/ar2-web/wiki/Environment-Variables)
-   docker-compose.yaml
-   Dockerfile
-   .github\workflows\web.yml

### Update the Wiki

Visit the [wiki](https://github.com/mssfoobar/ar2-web/wiki/Environment-Variables) and place your new environment
variable defaults there for others to copy. Also, provide a short description on what it's for (either in comments in
the sample `.env` file contents , or in the wiki itself).

### Configure Docker Compose files

In the `docker-compose.yml` file, you will need add additional args for the Dockerfile to take in

```yaml title=docker-compose.yml
services:
    web:
        build:
            args:
                - PUBLIC_FOO_BAR=${PUBLIC_FOO_BAR}
```

### Configure Dockerfile

You will need to modify the `Dockerfile` accordingly to take in your new environment variable/s.

```Dockerfile title=Dockerfile
...
ARG PUBLIC_FOO_BAR
ENV PUBLIC_FOO_BAR=${PUBLIC_FOO_BAR}
...
```

### Configuring the CI/CD

The CI needs to build your container image before being able to deploy it - depending on whether your environment
variable is statically replaced upon building, or dynamically introduced based on the environment, you'll have to
configure those environments accordingly.

If your environment variable value is a secret, and you need it during build time, create a
[secret in GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository).

Also, make sure your GitHub workflow file has it available the container build step:

```yml title=.github\workflows\web.yml

---
export PUBLIC_MAPBOX_KEY=${{ secrets.PUBLIC_MAPBOX_KEY }}
...

jobs
  build:
    steps:
      - name: build container image
        run: |
          ...
          export PUBLIC_FOO_BAR="Hello There!"
          ...
          docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml build web
```
