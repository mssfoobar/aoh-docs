# Configuration ⚙️

There are many levels of configuration available, however, to keep things simple, we'll only cover configuration specific
to `ar2-web`. Refer to [the list below](#other-modules) for helpful information on configuring the other modules.

The following list of environment variables are used during both development and deployment of the project.

## Environment Variables

Environment variables are managed by using a `.env` file in the root of the project. This `.env` file is loaded by
multiple programs and used in different ways. It is used by `docker-compose` to run the Dockerfile, and it is used by

Vite / Svelte Kit in two ways:

-   Static: Processed during build-time and statically replaced, these cannot change during run-time.
-   Dynamic: These can be changed during run-time by modifying the environment variable.

Refer to the [Svelte Kit $env API](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/modules#$env-dynamic-private) to learn how to access these variables (code in Svelte Kit
is differentiated as being available on both the client & server or server only. Code that is exposed to the client can only import env vars
that are marked `PUBLIC_` (to avoid leaking sensitive information to the browser).

The following is a non-exhaustive description of some of the environment variables used to configure `ar2-web`.

-   `FONTAWESOME_ACCESS_TOKEN` token required to access Font Awesome's npm registry.
-   `GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN` token required to access GitHub Packages' npm registry.
-   `NODE_ENV` set to `development` or `production` control production vs development settings (e.g. log level)
-   `PUBLIC_BUILD_VERSION` the CI will create this and set it on the deployed servers - this is useful for checking what the deployed version is on the front-end.
-   `PORT` port number the application will listen on.
-   `CLIENT_SECRET` token required to connect to the verification server

The full list of environment variables is available on the
[`ar2-web wiki`](https://github.com/mssfoobar/ar2-web/wiki/Environment-Variables)

If you need to add more variables to the `.env` file, remember to update the [`wiki`](https://github.com/mssfoobar/ar2-web/wiki/) and the
`docker-compose.yml` file's `environment` property to document the newly required variable(s).

Since Vite loads additional `.env` files based on the NODE_ENV (e.g. when NODE_ENV=development, it will load `.env.development`),
you can load and override variables using a `.env.[mode]` file.

:::info
Running `npm run dev` will run node with `NODE_ENV=development`.
See [Vite's official documentation](https://vitejs.dev/guide/env-and-mode.html#modes).
:::

### Setting your npm configuration to use the tokens

For local development, we recommend that you set the access tokens by running the `npm set` command:

```bash
npm set //npm.fontawesome.com/:_authToken=<YOUR_FONTAWESOME_ACCESS_TOKEN>
npm set //npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=<YOUR_GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN>
```

If you are running via Docker, you will need to set the `FONTAWESOME_ACCESS_TOKEN` and `GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN` env vars instead.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Windows PowerShell" label="Windows (PowerShell)" default>

```bash
$Env:FONTAWESOME_ACCESS_TOKEN=<YOUR_FONTAWESOME_ACCESS_TOKEN>
$Env:GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN=<YOUR_GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN>
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Windows CMD" label="Windows (cmd)">

```bash
set FONTAWESOME_ACCESS_TOKEN=<YOUR_FONTAWESOME_ACCESS_TOKEN>
set GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN=<YOUR_GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN>
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Linux" label="Linux">

```bash
export FONTAWESOME_ACCESS_TOKEN=<YOUR_FONTAWESOME_ACCESS_TOKEN>
export GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN=<YOUR_GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN>
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::info

Visit the [`ar2-web wiki`](https://github.com/mssfoobar/ar2-web/wiki/Sensitive-Tokens) to retrieve the access token.

:::

:::caution

Note that `PORT` is only used in production (when running `node ./build/index.js`).

To run with a different port during development, use the `--port` flag:

```bash
npm run preview --port 3001
```

## Quality of Life - VS Code

### Format On Save

We highly recommend you enable `Format On Save`. You can press `Ctrl + P` and type `Open User Settings` to
navigate to the user settings page, then type `format on save` and the relevant setting will show up:

### Recommended¹ Extensions

¹ More of a requirement really...

These are some extremely helpful extensions for Visual Studio Code and are integral to the development experience.

Install the Official Extensions:

-   [Svelte for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=svelte.svelte-vscode)  
    The Svelte extension provides code colouring and IntelliSense for Svelte, which itself is similar to jsx/tsx.
-   [Tailwind CSS IntelliSense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss)  
    The Tailwind CSS IntelliSense extension provides IntelliSense for Tailwind CSS.
-   [Playwright Test for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-playwright.playwright)  
    The Playwright Test extension allows you to debug Playwright Tests, record new tests, tune selectors, run
    individual tests, and more.
-   [Prettier - Code formatter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)
    Prettier handles formatting - our files should all be automatically formatted the same way - in the future, we
    might integrate this into CI/CD.
-   [VS Code ESLint extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)  
    The ESLint extension will provide ESLint information as you code - when linting is enforced in the CI, you will
    have to adhere to the standards before your code is merged - this extension will help with that.
-   [Docker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-docker)  
    The Docker extension provides Docker functionality in VS Code, including and especially IntelliSense for
    Dockerfiles.
-   [GitLens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens)  
    The GitLens extension provides enhanced Git functionality in VS Code, including showing who committed which lines
    of code (no more comments saying "//ADDED BY SO-AND-SO").

### Tailwind IntelliSense Hinters

You can get IntelliSense for Tailwind CSS classes in VS Code with some extra configuration:

//TODO Insert Screen2Gif instructions

We use `/* @tw */` comments to indicate that the following line of code is a Tailwind CSS class. To enable that
configuration, add the following line to your VS Code settings. After which, adding /_ @tw _/ above variables you
declare will have Tailwind IntelliSense.

```json
"tailwindCSS.experimental.classRegex": [
    "/\\*\\s*@tw\\s*\\*/[^\"]+\"([^\"]*)\"",
    "/\\*\\s*@tw\\s*\\*/[^']+'([^']*)'",
]
```

:::note
You can modify the regex to fit your own needs, but we recommend standardizing it so it works for all of us.
:::

### Tailwind IntelliSense on Custom Attributes

You should also configure the Tailwind VS Code extension's `Class Attributes`:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5701052/183502683-68957638-d54f-4da1-b60d-151c694ae83c.png)

Customizing this setting will allow custom component props to have Tailwind IntelliSense.

## Other Modules

Complete configuration of all the modules is beyond the scope of this document. To configure the list of other modules,
refer to their official documentation below:

-   `SvelteKit` - https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/configuration  
     SvelteKit can be configured in the `svelte.config.js` file in the root folder.

-   `SvelteKit Adapters` - https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters  
     We use the `@sveltejs/adapter-node` adapter to create a simple node server.

-   `Vite` - https://vitejs.dev/config/  
     Vite can be configured in the `vite.config.js` folder. Note that this used to be forwarded from the SvelteKit
    configuration. The Svelte maintainers have since changed this since the upgrade to `Vite 3.0.0`

-   `Vitest` - https://vitest.dev/config/  
     Vitest uses Vite's configuration, but you may override it by providing a `vitest.config.js` file in the root
    folder and passing `--config vitest.config.test` when running `vitest`.
-   `Playwright` - https://playwright.dev/docs/test-configuration  
     Playwright can be configured, in the `playwright.config.ts` file.

-   `GraphQL Code Generator` - https://www.graphql-code-generator.com/docs/config-reference/codegen-config  
    We use `GraphQL Code Generator` to generate the types from our GraphQL Schema. The configuration is in the
    `codegen.yml` file. Our default configuration is to expect your `schema.graphql` file in the root folder.

-   `eslint` - https://eslint.org/docs/latest/user-guide/configuring/rules
    Eslint is to help identify potential problems with our code and (along with our code formatter) help enforce our
    coding standards.
-   `TypeScript` - https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/tsconfig-json.html
    TypeScript can be configured in the `tsconfig.json` file in the root folder.
    Global types can be found in the `./src/global.d.ts` folder.

-   `Postcss` - https://github.com/postcss/postcss#usage  
     Postcss is a peer dependency for Tailwind CSS. We currently do not configure it but it is necessary.

-   `npmrc` - https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/configuring-npm/npmrc  
     The `.npmrc` file is used to configure the npm registries that we need such as GitHub Packages and FontAwesome.
