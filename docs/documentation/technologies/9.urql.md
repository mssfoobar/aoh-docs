## What is urql?

`urql` is a GraphQL client built to be highly customisable and versatile and exposes a set of helpers for several frameworks.

### Why we've chosen urql

When compared with other GraphQL clients such as `Apollo` and `Relay`, we chose `urql` because it has **smallest** base
bundle size and is very lightweight and extensible. Though Apollo is a big name, `Apollo Client` also has many issues
at the moment and requires more work to get working well with Svelte.

## Using urql

Import necessary types and functions from `urql`:

```ts
import type { Client } from '@urql/core';
import { createClient, defaultExchanges, subscriptionExchange } from '@urql/core';
```

Create the client:

```ts
myClient = writable<Client>(
    createClient({
        url: import.meta.env.VITE_GQL_HOST ? GQL_URL : 'http://your-graphql-endpoint.com/v1/graphql',

        fetchOptions: {
            headers: {
                'content-type': 'application/json',
                'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + jwt,
            },
        },

        exchanges: [
            ...defaultExchanges,
            subscriptionExchange({
                forwardSubscription: operation => ({
                    subscribe: sink => ({
                        unsubscribe: get(wsClient).subscribe(operation, sink),
                    }),
                }),
            }),
        ],
    })
);
```
