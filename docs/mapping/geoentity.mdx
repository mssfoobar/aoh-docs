# Geo-Entities

AGIL Ops Hub provides a standardized format for storing geographic data structures. The primary purpose of this is
to keep the information required to efficiently render entities on the map.

# Schema

## Geographic Entity (Base Interface)

<CodeBlock language="json">
    {JSON.stringify(GeoEntitySchema, null, 2)}
</CodeBlock>

---

## Building

Building data is separated from its floor data. This is done for performance reasons. Floors may contain a large amount
of information, so they are treated as separate entities and contain a reference to the building they are meant to be
a part of.

The main purpose of this `Building` geographic entity is to hold information describing the building (such as its name,
and where it sits etc.)

<CodeBlock language="json">{JSON.stringify(BuildingSchema, null, 2)}</CodeBlock>

---

## Floor

A floor in a building.

<CodeBlock language="json">{JSON.stringify(FloorSchema, null, 2)}</CodeBlock>

---

## Track

Tracks are moving entities that are typically 'tracked' via telemetry data. These could be delivery vans,
airplanes, or robots in a factory floor.

<CodeBlock language="json">{JSON.stringify(TrackSchema, null, 2)}</CodeBlock>

---

## Annotation

Overlay on a map.

<CodeBlock language="json">
    {JSON.stringify(AnnotationSchema, null, 2)}
</CodeBlock>
