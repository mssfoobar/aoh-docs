For the system to be successful, we require buy-in from all stakeholders, including and especially developers. The stack
we have is modern and aimed to please as many parties as we can. Clients' demands based on current technology
trends; which emphasizes secure, scalable, flexible systems, are met with the micro-service architecture. To help with
developers' needs, we focus on providing strong documentation, powerful modern tooling, and automation wherever it makes
sense.
