# TypeScript

We use `TypeScript` on top of JavaScript to help our code be much more maintainable.

## Why TypeScript?

`TypeScript` is a language for application-scale JavaScript. It adds optional types to JavaScript that support tools
for large-scale JavaScript applications. The benefit of having types allows our code editors to have helpful code
completion and type checking, and allows JavaScript to be _actually_ maintainable.

The goal is to have code that is more reliable, easier to read, and easier to refactor.
