# Playwright

We use `Playwright` to automate testing on our web app.

## What is Playwright?

`Playwright` is a framework for automating web end-to-end testing. It is built to enable cross-browser web automation,
and is designed to run fast and reliably (with auto-waiting for tests, we don't have to insert artificial timeouts).

### Why we've chosen Playwright

The main contenders to `Playwright` is `Selenium` and `Cypress`.

`Playwright` is much newer compared to the other two, however, it has many advantages. Compared to `Selenium`, it
creates much more reliable tests. For interaction with DOM elements, `Selenium` assumes that the element is going to be
found already loaded on the page and if the element is not there, the test fails.

`Playwright` however, has locators that have "awaits" natively, making execution of tests much more stable (yes, 
`Cypress` also has a similar feature).

On top of that, `Playwright` supports Chromium, Firefox and Webkit (Safari).
`Cypress` only supports Chromium and Firefox.

The main advantange `Cypress` has over `Playwright` is that it is easy
to set up and get-going and that it is more mature, however, `Playwright` is ultimately more powerful, and as the
product matures, we also expect it to dominate the test market.

## Using Playwright

Import `test` and `expect` to test using `Playwright`:

```ts
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';
```

Write a test:

```ts
test('Title Test', async ({ page }) => {
    await page.goto('http://localhost:3000');
    const title = page.locator('title');
    await expect(title).toHaveText('Home');
});
```

You can also use [Playwright's test generator](https://playwright.dev/docs/codegen) to generate the test code based
on actions you perform directly on the browser - similar to Selenium's Record and Playback and Cypress Studio.

```
npx playwright codegen http://localhost:3000
```
:::note
You need to have the `Playwright` browsers installed, if you haven't already done so, run `npx playwright install` first.
