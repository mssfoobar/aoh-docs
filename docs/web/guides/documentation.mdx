# Documentation ðŸ“–

We use [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) to create this documentation website. The Docusaurus site is automatically
published from the `./docusaurus` directory (it is a separate `React` website) when code is pushed. Edit the `.md` or
`.mdx` files to make changes. When browsing the documentation, you may click the 'Edit this page' button to edit the
markdown file directly on GitHub. Saving it will trigger the documentation site to be re-built automatically.
