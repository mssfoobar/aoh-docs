## What is GraphQL?

`GraphQL` is a query language and server-side language runtime for APIs that prioritizes giving clients the data they
request. `GraphQL` is designed to make APIs fast, flexible and developer-friendly.

### Why we've chosen GraphQL

With `GraphQL`, the structure of your query is exactly the same as the result it returns. You don't get _partial_
payloads, that you have to sift through on the client side. This makes processing the data on the client side much
easier and more flexible (depending what GraphQL queries we expose to the client).

GraphQL also allows has an introspection feature, which fuels API discovery and makes writing queries much easier.
